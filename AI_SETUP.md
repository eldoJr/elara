# Elara AI Setup Instructions

## Phase 1 Implementation Complete âœ…

We've successfully implemented the foundation for Elara's AI-powered e-commerce platform using DeepSeek API.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. AI Service Layer
- **DeepSeek API Integration** (`djangoapp/services/ai_service.py`)
- Chat completion with context awareness
- Product recommendation generation
- Natural language shopping query processing

### 2. User Behavior Tracking
- **New Models Added:**
  - `UserBehavior` - Tracks user interactions (views, searches, cart actions, AI chats)
  - `ConversationHistory` - Stores AI chat conversations with context
  - `ProductRecommendation` - Caches AI-generated recommendations

### 3. Enhanced AI Chat System
- **Upgraded AI Chat Endpoint** (`/api/assistant/chat/`)
- Context-aware responses using user behavior data
- Product catalog integration for intelligent recommendations
- Session management and conversation history

### 4. Frontend AI Assistant
- **New Component:** `AIAssistant.tsx`
- Real-time chat interface with DeepSeek AI
- Modern UI with message history and typing indicators
- Integrated into Home page

### 5. Behavior Analytics
- **Product View Tracking** - Automatically tracks when users view products
- **AI Chat Tracking** - Records all AI interactions for learning
- **Session Management** - Maintains context across conversations

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Add to your environment (`.env` file or system environment):

```bash
# DeepSeek AI Configuration
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
```

### 2. Database Migration
Run the migration to create new AI-related tables:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Dependencies are already included in `requirements.txt`:
- `requests>=2.31.0` (for API calls)

### 4. Test the AI Assistant
1. Start the Django server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Start the React frontend: `cd web && npm start`
3. Visit the homepage and interact with the AI Assistant
4. Try queries like:
   - "Show me electronics"
   - "What products do you recommend?"
   - "Help me find a laptop"

## How It Works

### AI Flow
1. **User Input** â†’ Frontend sends message to `/api/assistant/chat/`
2. **Context Building** â†’ Backend gathers user behavior and product data
3. **AI Processing** â†’ DeepSeek API generates intelligent response
4. **Response** â†’ AI provides personalized recommendations and answers
5. **Learning** â†’ System tracks interaction for future improvements

### Data Flow
```
User Interaction â†’ UserBehavior Model â†’ AI Context â†’ DeepSeek API â†’ Personalized Response
```

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Ready to Implement:
1. **Smart Search Enhancement**
   - Semantic search using AI embeddings
   - Natural language query processing

2. **Personalized Recommendations**
   - Homepage personalization based on user behavior
   - "Recommended for You" sections

3. **Advanced AI Features**
   - Product comparison assistance
   - Shopping list management
   - Price optimization suggestions

## Testing the AI

### Sample Queries to Try:
- "What are your best electronics?"
- "I'm looking for a gift for my mom"
- "Show me products under $50"
- "What's trending right now?"
- "Help me find a laptop for gaming"

### Expected AI Behavior:
- **Context Awareness**: AI remembers previous conversations
- **Product Knowledge**: AI can recommend from actual product catalog
- **Personalization**: Responses improve based on user behavior
- **Natural Language**: AI understands casual shopping queries

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Track AI Performance:
- Monitor `ConversationHistory` table for chat patterns
- Analyze `UserBehavior` data for engagement metrics
- Review AI response quality and user satisfaction

### Key Metrics to Watch:
- AI chat engagement rate
- Product recommendation click-through
- User session duration improvement
- Conversion rate from AI recommendations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **No AI Response**: Check `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable
2. **Database Errors**: Run `python manage.py migrate`
3. **Frontend Errors**: Ensure React components are properly imported

### Debug Mode:
Enable Django logging to see AI service calls:
```python
# In settings.py
LOGGING['loggers']['djangoapp.services'] = {
    'level': 'DEBUG'
}
```
