# Project Elara

## Vision
Project Elara is a next-generation AI-powered e-commerce platform designed to merge shopping convenience, personalization, and intelligent product discovery. By leveraging Django for the backend and React for the frontend, it provides scalability, security, and seamless user experience.

## Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: Django + Django REST Framework (API-driven, modular apps for products, users, orders, and AI assistant)
- **Frontend**: React for modern, responsive UI with a personalized shopping experience
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary store for products, users, and orders)
- **AI Assistant**: Connected via Django service layer integrating with AI models (OpenAI, HuggingFace, or custom)
- **Deployment**: Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes or Railway
- **Static Content**: Managed by Django staticfiles or served via CDN for performance
